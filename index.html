HELP! is an album by The Beatles made in 1965. The Beatles is a band that originated in Liverpool, England in 1960. Help is the fifth album by the rock band, which is aslo the soundtrack for their movie by the same name. Seven of the fourteen songs, including the singles "Help!" and "Ticket to Ride", appeared in the film and took up the first side of the vinyl album. The second side contained "yesterday". This is the most covered song ever written. The album received positive critic reviews and surpassed the charts in Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.

In the United States, HELP! marked the beginning of the artistic admiration of mainstream critics of the Beatles, including a comparison with the European art music tradition. It was nominated for the Album of the Year at the 1966 Grammy Awards, and was the first rock band to be honored in that category. In 2000, it was ranked 119 in the third edition of Colin Larkin`s book "All Time Top 1000 Albums". In 2020, it was ranked 266th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". In September 2013, after the British Phonographic Industry changed its sales award rules, Help! was certified platinum for recorded sales since 1994.

The album featured Paul McCartney's "Yesterday", arranged for guitar and string quartet, and recorded without other band members. John Lennon's "You've Got to Hide Your Love Away" shows the influence of Bob Dylan and includes the flute. Released as a single in April 1965, "Ticket to Ride" is a "heavy"  sound compared to the group's previous output by Lennon, implying boys and girls living together. I understand. McCartney called this arrangement "quite radical." During the album's recording session, the band used the studio's multitrack capabilities to layer the sound. In it, author Mark Prendergast admits that George Harrison used a volume pedal to incorporate a “more intricate chordal devices to enrich his guitar sound" As a
songwriter, Harrison contributed "I Need You" and "You Like Me Too Much". These were his first compositions  on the Beatles album since "Don't Bother Me" on 1963’s With The Beatles. This record featured two covers and some tracks that were close to the group's previous pop output, but still made an important step forward. Record sleeves show a wider and more prominent use of keyboards that Lennon and McCartney were previously played unobtrusively by Martin. 4-track overdubbing technology helped this. On his side, Lennon made much more use of the acoustic guitar and omitted his famous Rickenbacker.

The  format of  the original LP follows the format of A Hard Day's Night, with soundtrack songs on Side 1 and non-soundtrack songs on Side 2. Later in, Lennon explained that the album's title track was a sincere cry for help. He regretted turning it from a discouraged piano-led ballad to an up-tempo pop song. It was done only because of commercial pressure.

 Help! It was the band's last UK album (excluding the late 1966 compilation A Collection of Beatles Oldies) featuring cover songs up to the 1970s Let It Be (including the performance of the traditional folk song "Maggie Mae"). In 1966, Capitol released "Act Naturally". Already on the British Help! Album,  on Yesterday and Today. "Bad Boy" and "Dizzy Miss Lizzy" (both written by Larry Williams and recorded on Williams' birthday, May 10, 1965) were both for the American market and were not originally  intended for Help!. But, "Dizzy Miss Lizzy" appeared on the album. Both songs appeared in Beatles VI, released in the United States in June 1965. "Bad Boy" was first released in the UK with the Beatles Oldies collection and was the only cover song on the album. The  album contains Paul McCartney's "Yesterday", arranged for guitar and string quartet and recorded without anyone else. Some songs that were recorded for albums and movies and were intended  were not used. Lennon and McCartney wrote "If You've Got Trouble" for Ringo Starr to sing, but the Beatles weren't happy with the song, it was abandoned, and Starr sang "Act Naturally" instead. rice field. "That Means a Lot" was written for this movie, but  the Beatles were dissatisfied with  the song and the recording of P.J. Presented to  Proby  released  as a single. Lennon said, "Yes It Is" was "me trying a rewrite of 'This Boy', but it didn't work"; It was released as the b-side of "Ticket to Ride" and was also released on The Beatles VI. "You Like Me Too Much" and "Tell Me What You See" appeared on the album (and Beatles VI), but were rejected by director Richard Lester for use in the film.
